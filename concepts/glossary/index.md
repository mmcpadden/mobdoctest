# Glossary of API Terms

### API 
Application Programming Interface. A software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other.

### API Key
An authorization code passed with an API request via a header or parameter to identify the requester.

### Authentication 
Identifying the user of the API. Common techniques for authentication include API Keys and OAuth.

### Call 
A request sent by a user to the API, in the form of a URL string, which invokes a specific action on one particular resource. It may also include additional parameters or header values.

### Collection 
An API resource that groups other resources together.

### Endpoint 
The URI that goes after the base URL and points towards the requested API functionality.

### Header 
The header is the data that is sent preceding the body of an HTTP request or response.

### HTTP
Hypertext transport protocol. It is one of the key architectural components behind how web-based content on the Internet is accessed through web browsers.

### HTTP Methods 
Standard ”HTTP verbs” that identify a type of action that an HTTP client might perform against a resource. Common HTTP methods include:

* *GET* - For retrieving resources from a system with a RESTful API.
* *POST* - For creating resources.
* *PUT* - For updating resources.
* *DELETE* - For removing records.

### HTTPS 
Hypertext transport protocol secure. It is the same in principle and function as HTTP, but exists when data transmitted via HTTP is encrypted before it is sent.

### Hypermedia 
Any content type which allows entities to link to each other in a standardized way, making other entities discoverable from a client.

### Idempotent
When the results of multiple requests are the same as a single request. GET, PUT, and DELETE are idempotent methods.

### JSON 
Javascript Object Notation is a data format commonly used for APIs requests parameters and response body.

### OAuth
Open standard authorization framework. Grants access on behalf of an end user without directly sharing credentials.

### Parameter
An argument sent to the API which helps define the request and expected response.

### Proxy
An intermediary for requests from clients and servers providing resources.

### RAML
A YAML-based language for describing RESTful and "pragmatically-RESTful" APIs.  

### Request 
A call sent by a user to the API, in the form of a URL string, which invokes a specific action on one particular endpoint. It may also include additional parameters or header values.

### REST 
Representational state transfer. An architectural pattern for interacting with resources via HTTP methods. It is a form of software architecture that is primarily used for web service design. The World Wide Web is based on REST.

### Resource 
An object or entity that has a URI and can be manipulated through standard HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, etc.).

### Response 
Data that an API sends back to a user after it is called via a request. The format of an API response is typically JSON (or XML).

### URI
Unique Resource Identifier. A string of characters used to identify a resource. The most common form of URI is the Uniform Resource Locator (URL).

### URL
Uniform Resource Locator. The unique address for any object or function that can be accessed or invoked on the Web.

### Versioning 
Assigning a unique identifier to keep track of the state of the API. If breaking changes are made to the API, the version number will be incremented.

### XML
Extensible Markup Language. A language used for providing information as well as describing that information, such that programs can interpret data without really understanding the data itself.
