# Versioning Policy

Tangoe can support multiple versions of our APIs in order to enable the introduction of new features without disrupting use of an existing API by third-party consumers. Moreover, we provide ample notice to our existing consumers so that they can make appropriate plans for migrating to the latest version. *(Please note: APIs are subject to change without prior notice if a security vulnerability is discovered within the current functionality.)*

<br/>

## Version Numbers and Backwards Compatibility

New/expanded functionality may be added at any time but the version number will not change. Backwards compatibility will be maintained and API consumers can continue to use it without modification to their code. The API version number will only be incremented when a breaking change is introduced. At that time, all older versions of the API will be considered deprecated. 

<br/>

## Deprecation Policy

Although deprecated versions of the API will continue to be supported for a limited time, they will no longer be actively maintained. As soon as a version is labeled as deprecated, consumers of that API version should begin taking steps to upgrade to the current/active version. 

Every version of the API is guaranteed to remain supported for at least **six months** from the date that a newer version is released. **After six months, deprecated API versions may no longer work properly and could be retired at any time.**

<br/>

## Retirement

APIs that are marked as retired may no longer work properly and should no longer be relied upon. Moreover, these obsolete versions can be removed at any time and therefore should not be used.
