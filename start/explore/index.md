# Test and Explore the API

Once you have made your <a href="{{site.url}}/start/first-call/">first call</a> via the Developer Portal, you will be ready to explore the rest of the Mobile Procurement API.

Every resource in this API offers similar documentation that explains its purpose and query parameters, as well as the same mechanism for testing it. Simply enter the appropriate headers and query parameter values, then click the button labeled with the desired HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST). A sample response, populated with your own data, will be returned.
